### It's "vertices", not "vertexes"
First of all <https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vertexes>.

### Actually if you read the "Rust programming language" book it clearly says: "Itâ€™s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between."
There's a lot of talk around the internet about respecting each other's differences, and rightfully so. So I would appreciate it if people could respect this difference of mine.
