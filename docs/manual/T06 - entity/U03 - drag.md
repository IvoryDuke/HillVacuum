### Left mouse + cursor drag
If there is a selected entity beneath the cursor, all selected entities are dragged around the map. If there is no entity, a drag selection is initiated.  
When the mouse button is released, the entities within the drag selection area are exclusively selected.  
Pressing `Ctrl` all attached brushes are selected as well.
