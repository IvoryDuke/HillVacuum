### INFO
Brushes can be tied together into a group through the Anchor subtool. This establishes a owner-anchored relation between the brushes. An "owner" brush can have an unlimited amount of brushes tied to it. A brush that is anchored can have none.  
When the "owner" brush is moved all anchored brushes are moved as well even if they are not selected.
