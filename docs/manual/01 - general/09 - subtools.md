### Subtools
Subtools are UI elements that show up on the right when certain tools are selected to provide easy access to functions bound to hardcoded shortcuts.  
Left clicking the first time enables them, clicking a second time disables them.  
Every subtool shows the associated keyboard shortcut in the tooltip.  
Subtools can be disabled by pressing Escape.
