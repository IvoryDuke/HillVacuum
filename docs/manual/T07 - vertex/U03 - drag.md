### Left mouse + cursor drag
If there is a selected vertex beneath the cursor, all selected vertexes are dragged around the map. Unless the move generates at least one illegally shaped brush. If a moved vertex overlaps a non selected one, this vertex is selected as well.  
If there is no vertex, a rectangular selection is initiated. When the mouse button is released, the vertexes within the rectangular selection area are exclusively selected.
