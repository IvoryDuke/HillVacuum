### Side xtrusion subtool
Selecting it and then left clicking on a selected side of starts the xtrusion process.
If the cursor is moved away from the brush, the side is extruded, generating a new brush. Otherwise the brush is split in two by a line with the same slope as the selected side.  
Both extrusion and intrusion can be executed on multiple selected sides, as long as they all have the same slope.
