### Left mouse + cursor drag
If there is a selected side beneath the cursor, all selected sides are dragged around the map. Unless the move generates at least one illegally shaped brush. If there is no side, a drag selection is initiated.\nWhen the mouse button is released, the sides within the drag selection area are exclusively selected.  
If a moved side overlaps a non selected one, this side is selected as well.
