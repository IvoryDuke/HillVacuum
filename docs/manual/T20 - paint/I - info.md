### INFO
When created, the props can be stored in slots displayed in the UI gallery at the bottom of the screen (such gallery is not shown if there are no stored props).  
Props can either be stored in a numbered slot by specifying its number in the window that pops up during the prop creation process, or in the quick slot by not typing any number. Only one prop can be placed in the quick slot.
