### INFO
When enabled, the entities are split in three groups:  
- entities that have a path and are selected, and the brushes attached to them;  
- entities that are selected, but do not have a path and are not attached to another brush. Therefore they are entities which can have a path;  
- all other cases, entities that are not selected and/or cannot have a path.
