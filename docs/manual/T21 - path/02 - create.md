### Alt + Left mouse
If an entity that can have a path is clicked the path creation is enabled.  
Otherwise, if a node is clicked, inserts a new node in the path of the clicked node, after such node. The node can then be dragged around as long as it does not cause the resulting path to have consecutive overlapping nodes.
