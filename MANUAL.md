## General

### Brush
A brush is a convex polygonal surfaces. It can have an associated texture which can either be drawn filling its surface or as a sprite. The sprite can be displaced independently of the brush's surface.  
Brushes can also be assigned a path that describes how it moves in the bidimensional space and that can be edited with the Path tool.  
Finally, brushes have a built-in property, `collision`, which determines whether they should represent a clipping surface or not. It can be edited in the properties window.

### Thing
A thing is an object which can be placed around the map. It is characterized by an ID, a width and height, a name, and a texture which represents it.  
Things can also be assigned a path that describes how it moves in the bidimensional space and that can be edited with the Path tool.  
Things can either be defined in one or many .ini files to be placed in the `assets/things/` folder or, if `HillVacuum` is used as a library, adding them to the `hardcoded_things` field of the `HillVacuumPlugin` to insert them in the bevy App.  
If defined in the .ini files, the things must follow a similar format:
```ini
[Name]
width = N
height = M
id = ID
preview = TEX
```
Where `ID` is an unique identifier between 0 and 65534, and `TEX` is the name of the texture (without the file extension) to be drawn along with the bounding box.  
If the texture assigned to the Thing has an animation, the texture will be drawn accordingly.  
  
If a thing in the `HillVacuumPlugin` has the same `ID` as one loaded from file, the latter will overwrite the former.  
Finally, things have two built-in properties, `angle` and `draw height`. The orientation of the arrow drawn on top of the things will change based on the value of `angle`, and `draw height` determines its draw order. They can be edited in the properties window.
  
Things can be reloaded while the application is running through the UI button in the Options menu.

### Properties
Properties are custom user defined values which can be associated to brushes and things.  
Such values can be added to the application through the `brush_properties` and `thing_properties` fields of the `HillVacuumPlugin`.  
Properties can be edited per-entity using the properties window.  
Currently supported value types are `bool`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `f32`, `f64`, and `String`.  
  
!!! If a saved map contains properties that differ in type and/or name from the ones defined in the aforementioned resources, a warning window will appear on screen when trying to load the `.hv` file, asking whether you'd like to use the app or map ones.

### Texture
Textures must be placed in the `assets/textures/` folder to be loaded.  
The texture editor can be opened at any time to edit the properties of the textures of the selected brushes.  
Entity, scale, and rotate tool also feature texture editing capabilities. These capabilities can be either enabled through the dedicated "Target" UI element in the bottom left area, or by pressing `Alt + texture editor bind`.  
Textures can have an associated animation which can either consist of a list of textures to display, each one for a specific time, or an atlas of textures generated by subdividing the textures in subareas. The animations can be applied to the texture as a default or to the texture of the selected brushes only.  
When editing a list type animation, it is possible to add a texture by clicking it with the left mouse button.  
To edit the animation of a texture that is not the one of the selected brushes, it needs to be pressed with the right mouse button.  
  
Textures can be reloaded while the application is running through the UI button in the Options menu.  
Default textures animation can be exported and imported between map files. The file extension of the animations files is `.anms`.

### Prop
A prop is a collection of entities which can be painted around the map like the brushes of an image editing tool.  
Each prop has a pivot, the point relative to which it is painted onto the map.  
Props can be imported and exported between map files. The file extension of the props files is `.prps`.

### Path
A path is a series of nodes describing how the entity that owns it moves over time around the map.  
Nodes have five customizable parameters:  
- `Standby`: the amount of time the entity stands still before starting to move to the next node;  
- `Min speed`: the minimum speed the entity moves;  
- `Max speed`: the maximum speed the entity reaches;  
- `Accel (%)`: the percentage of the distance between the current node and the next that the entity will spend accelerating from the minimum to the maximum speed;  
- `Decel (%)`: the percentage of the distance between the current node and the next that the entity will spend decelerating from the maximum to the minimum speed.  

The maximum speed can never be lower than the minimum speed and it can never be 0. The acceleration and deceleration percentages always amount to 100% at most. The acceleration phase always comes before the deceleration one.  
A path can have overlapping nodes. However, two consecutive nodes cannot overlap. Overlapping nodes are clearly shown in the tooltips. Therefore, it is highly encouraged to leave them on.

### Grid
The map grid can be skewed and/or rotated to give the map an isometric look. These two parameters can be edited in the settings window.

### Cursor
A semitransparent square is shown on screen to represent the world position of the cursor. This is useful to show where the camera will zoom in/out when pressing `Ctrl + Mouse wheel`.

### Subtools
Subtools are UI elements that show up on the right when certain tools are selected to provide easy access to functions bound to hardcoded shortcuts.  
Left clicking the first time enables them, clicking a second time disables them.  
Every subtool shows the associated keyboard shortcut in the tooltip.  
Subtools can also be disabled by pressing `Escape`.

### Tab
Whenever a tool allows you to select/deselect entities, `Tab` can be pressed to select the next element beneath it, if any.

### Tools
Tools can be selected by clicking the icons on the left side of the screen or by pressing the bound key.  
Bound keys can be viewed and changed through the bind menu.

### Shift + Left mouse
If there is a vertex beneath the cursor, its selection status is toggled.

### Left mouse + cursor drag
If there is a selected vertex beneath the cursor, all selected vertexes are dragged around the map. Unless the move generates at least one illegally shaped brush. If a moved vertex overlaps a non selected one, this vertex is selected as well.  
If there is no vertex, a rectangular selection is initiated. When the mouse button is released, the vertexes within the rectangular selection area are exclusively selected.

### Shift + Left mouse + cursor drag
Same as `Left mouse + cursor drag`, except the vertexes within the boundary of the rectangular selection are added to the selected brushes if they are not already selected.

### Up/Down/Left/Right
Moves the selected vertexes one grid square away in the pressed direction, unless the move generates at least one illegally shaped brush.  
If a moved vertex overlaps a non selected one, it is selected as well.

### Backspace

Selecting it and then left clicking on a selected side of starts the xtrusion process.
If the cursor is moved away from the brush, the side is extruded, generating a new brush. Otherwise the brush is split in two by a line with the same slope as the selected side.  
Both extrusion and intrusion can be executed on multiple selected sides, as long as they all have the same slope.

### Sides merge subtool (Alt + Merge tool bind)

Places the points through which the clipping line passes.

### Tab
Changes the brushes that are spawned after the clip has been executed.  
By default, both brushes on the right and left of the clip line are spawned, but this can be changed to just the left or right ones. If `Alt` is pressed as well the brushes are cycled in the opposite order.

### INFO
When created, the props can be stored in slots displayed in the UI gallery at the bottom of the screen (such gallery is not shown if there are no stored props).  
Props can either be stored in a numbered slot by specifying its number in the window that pops up during the prop creation process, or in the quick slot by not typing any number. Only one prop can be placed in the quick slot.

### Prop creation subtool (Enter)  
<img src="images/paint_creation.svg" alt="paint_creation" height="48" width="48"/>

### Backspace
Deletes all selected nodes, unless doing so would generate a path with a single node or a path with consecutive overlapping nodes.

### Alt + backspace
Deletes the paths of the selected entities.

### Up/Down/Left/Right
